Copy the exploded "jboss-rails.deployer/" directory to the 'deployers/' 
directory of server configuration you're using.

For example, if you are using the 'all' configuration, you could
execute this commandline

  $ cp -R jboss-rails.deployer $JBOSS_HOME/server/all/deployers/

It is recommended (but not strictly necessary) to stop the AS before
adding in the deployer.
