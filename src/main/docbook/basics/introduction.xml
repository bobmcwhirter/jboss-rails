  <para>
  JBoss Rails provides an enterprise-grade environment that not only
  provides complete Ruby-on-Rails compatibility, but also goes beyond
  the functionality offered in traditional Rails environments.

    <para>
    Ruby-on-Rails (also referred to as "RoR" or "Rails") is one of the most popular 
    Model-View-Controller (MVC) frameworks for the Ruby language.  It was originally 
    created by David Heinemeier Hansson at <ulink url="http://37signals.com/">37signals</ulink> 
    during the course of building many actual Ruby applications for their consulting business.
    </para>

    <para>
    Rails has straight-forward components representing models, views, and controllers.
    The framework as a whole values convention over configuration.  It has been described
    as "opinionated software" in that many decisions have been taken away from the end-user.
    </para>

    <para>
    It is exactly the opinionated nature of Rails that allows it to be considered a
    simple and agile framework for quickly building web-based applications.  Additionally,
    since Ruby is an interpreted language instead of compiled, the assets of an application
    can be edited quickly, with the results being immediately available.  In most cases,
    the application does not need to be restarted to see changes in models, views or
    controllers reflected.

      Introduction to Rails on JBoss
    </title>

    <para>
    Since Ruby-on-Rails ostensibly doesn't do anything new, but simply does it
    with a different language, JBoss Rails uses the power of 
    <ulink url="http://jruby.org/">JRuby</ulink> to deploy regular Ruby-on-Rails
    apps within the JBoss AS appserver.
    </para>

    <para>
    Your Rails application gets deployed alongside any other WAR or EAR, complete
    with the ability to run on a cluster. The full JBoss Web stack is utilized to
    provide enterprise-grade serviing for Rails applications.
    </para>

    <para>
    JBoss Rails goes beyond stock Ruby-on-Rails, though, by providing access to
    additional technologies, such as: 
      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          SOAP using <ulink url="http://cxf.apache.org/">Apache-CXF</ulink>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          Recurring task scheduling using Quartz
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          Asynchronous work queues using <ulink url="http://www.jboss.org/jbossmessaging/">JBoss Messaging</ulink>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          SIP integration using <ulink url="http://mobicents.org/">Mobicents</ulink>
