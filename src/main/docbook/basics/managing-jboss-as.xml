    <title>Differences between Traditional and JBoss applications</title>

    <para>In traditional deployment, the Rails application itself is
    responsible for propping up a listener in port 80. It may use library code
    provided by system-wide or application-specific gems. Some of the library
    code provides web-listening functionality.</para>

      </mediaobject>When deploying an application on a Ruby-enabled JBoss AS
    instance, the application server itself is responsible for providing the
    port-80 listener, and routing requests to the appropriate application. The
    application does not directly control the network layer. Additionally,
    since an application server is a shared resource, the application must
    provide all of its own dependencies to the AS.</para>
